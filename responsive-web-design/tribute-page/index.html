                    Tommy Flowers was born in London's East End on 22 December
                    1905, the son of a bricklayer. After an apprenticeship in
                    mechanical engineering, he earned a degree in electrical
                    engineering at the University of London. In 1926, he joined
                    the telecommunications branch of the General Post Office
                    (GPO), moving to work at the research station at Dollis Hill
                    on the northwest side of London in 1930. From 1935 onward,
                    he explored the use of electronics for telephone exchanges.
                    By 1939, he was convinced that an all-electronic system was
                    possible. This background in switching electronics would
                    prove crucial for his computer design in World War II.

                    Flowers was first brought into the codebreaking world to
                    work on Alan Turing's Bombe, a system designed to break
                    Enigma codes. A more complicated cipher, Lorenz, required a
                    new system to crack. In order to break it, Flowers proposed
                    the design for the machine that would become known as
                    Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic
                    computer. Management at Bletchley Park, the UK's
                    codebreaking centre, was sceptical and encouraged Flowers to
                    continue alone rather than prioritising the project. Flowers
                    put his own money into the machine to get the project off
                    the ground. It paid off - he was soon assigned staff and
                    priority access to resources. Flowers had pursued the use of
                    valves rather than electro-mechanical switches in the
                    construction, which caused heated debate, but when Colossus
                    began operating at Bletchley Park in January 1944, his
                    system ran five times faster than the rival
                    electro-mechanical switch machine, named Heath Robinson.

                    A Mark II redesign of Colossus entered service on 1 June
                    1944 and immediately provided vital intelligence regarding
                    the D-Day landings, such as the disposition of German troops
                    in Normandy. The machines continued providing vital
                    intelligence until the end of the war. Ten units were
                    operational during World War II. All but two were dismantled
                    after the war. This last pair of Colossi may have provided
                    codebreaking services during the Cold War before finally
                    being decommissioned in 1959 and 1960.

                    Flowers was rewarded with an MBE and a £1,000 grant, which
                    did not even cover his investment in Colossus. His work was
                    not publicly revealed until the 1970s. Today, the place of
                    Colossus in computing history is assured, and Flowers is
                    acknowledged as the principal architect of the machine.
